Write a function, that will trigger upon ticking a box, will count the amount of activated checkbox widgets
and if the amount is 0 or 1, it'll activate the selected checkbox, and if the new amount is 2, then it'll disable the unchecked boxes
or something along those lines. Should be simple enough to make.
